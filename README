Abstract
--------

Crypt::GCrypt provides a Perl interface to the libgcrypt cryptographic
functions. It currently supports symmetric ciphers such as AES/Rikndael, 
Twofish, Triple DES, Arcfour etc., while asymmetric cryptography is being
developed.

------------
Requirements
------------

Crypt::GCrypt requires that libgcrypt is installed on your system. You can
use your favourite package manager or download the latest version of libgcrypt 
at the GNU site:

ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/

and then you can install it just doing:

    $  ./configure
    $  make
    #  make install

Crypt::GCrypt was tested with libgcrypt 1.2.4.

If libgcrypt is installed, but in a non-standard directory, then use the
following options to Makefile.PL:

    GCRYPTLIBPATH=...  To set the directory in which to find libgcrypt
    GCRYPTINCPATH=...  To set the directory in which to find gcrypt.h

For example:
    perl Makefile.PL GCRYPTLIBPATH=/home/me/lib GCRYPTINCPATH=/home/me/include

Note that if you build against a shareable library in a non-standard location
you may (on some platforms) also have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable at run time for perl to find the library.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

Crypt::GCrypt may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual manner.  Typically:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Crypt::GCrypt'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme Crypt::GCrypt

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install Crypt::GCrypt

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

This module may also be installed manually.  Its distribution is
available from the author's CPAN directory,
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/A/AA/AAR/>, or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.

Thanks for reading!
