version 1.22 (2009/11/01):

    - now thread-safe (patch by Daniel K. Gillmor)

version 1.21 (2009/02/04):

    - added Devel::CheckLib to avoid FAIL reports from CPAN testers

version 1.20 (2008/01/25):

    - new "none" padding method

    - added an optimization to make the new API a bit retrocompatible
      in some special cases
    
    - padding recognition is more robust

    - [API CHANGE] ->finish() is now required after decrypting, because
      the previous implementation contained a bug when decrypting data 
      in multiple calls to ->decrypt(): the module tried to strip
      padding at every call, thus removing wrong bytes in some cases.
      Added the 06-multi.t test and a warning for users who don't 
      call the ->finish() method.
      (thanks to Paul Kolano for bug report and test case)
